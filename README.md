# Discord RSS
Polls RSS feeds and posts updates to Discord via a webhook.

## Description
This is a simple Python application which gathers RSS feeds from a text file, polls them occasionally, and outputs new entries to a Discord channel via a [Discord Webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).

The scope of this project very limited, and was created specifically for use in our Discord server. If you wants something more advanced check out [MonitoRSS](https://github.com/synzen/monitorss).
